# String Comparison

String Comparison for C#.NET

## Project Description

StringComparison is a library developed for reconciling naming conventions between different models of the electric grid.
I have stripped off the power system specific code and put together what can effectively be used as a string extension for determining approximate equality between two strings.
All of the algorithms used here have been pulled from online resources, translated into C#, and compiled into this library.
I found several other similar open-source implementations around but nothing for .NET/C#. Adding the *.dll to your project will give you access to this extension and the individual extensions under the hood of the `IsSimilarity()` extension.

## Algorithms included in this project

* [Hamming Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)

* [Jaro-Winkler Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro_distance)
* [Levenshtein Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)
* [Longest Common Subsequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem)
* [Longest Common Substring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_substring)
* [Overlap Coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlap_coefficient)
* [Ratcliff-Obershelp Similarity](http://www.morfoedro.it/doc.php?n=223&lang=en)
* [Sorensen-Dice Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient)
* [Tanimoto Coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanimoto_coefficient#Tanimoto_coefficient_.28extended_Jaccard_coefficient.29)

## String Comparision

While all of the algorithms are exposed and can be used and can provide their raw results,
they have been conveniently combined in a way that they can selectively be used to judge the approximate equality of two strings.
This is done through the `IsSimilar` extension and by setting the desired `StringComparisonOptions` and `StringComparisonTolerance`.

For two strings that are desired to be compared approximately, a boolean response of equality can be garnered in the following way:

## Installation

Download last release https://github.com/Behzadkhosravifar/StringComparison/releases

or install from NuGet https://www.nuget.org/packages/StringComparison. To install run the following command in the Package Manager Console
```
Install-Package StringComparison
```

## Usage

```c#

string source = "behzad";
string target = "behsad";

var options = new List<StringComparisonOptions>();

// Choose which algorithms should weigh in for the comparison
options.Add(StringComparisonOptions.UseOverlapCoefficient);
options.Add(StringComparisonOptions.UseLongestCommonSubsequence);
options.Add(StringComparisonOptions.UseLongestCommonSubstring);

// Choose the relative strength of the comparison - is it almost exactly equal? or is it just close?
var tolerance = StringComparisonTolerance.Strong;

// Get a boolean determination of approximate equality
bool result = source.IsSimilar(target, options, tolerance);
double howManySimilar = source.SimilarityPercent(target, options);
double simLevenshtein = source.LevenshteinDistancePercentage(target);
double simJaro = 1 - source.JaroDistance(target);

```
